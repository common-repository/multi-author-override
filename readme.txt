Simple plugin providing the option to manually set whether the theme should treat the blog as having a single or multiple authors, regardless of the true number.
 
== Description ==
 
Some themes will display elements only if the blog is single or multi author, e.g. showing author bios only if there are multiple contributors to the blog.

This plugin adds an option to override this behaviour, so that the theme will behave either as a single author blog (even where there are multiple authors) or as a multi-author blog (even where there is only one author).

== Installation ==

 
1. Upload `multi-author-override.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory OR 
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Or install through the Wordpress.org plugin directory and activate.

After activating go to Options > Multi-Author Override

You can set the option here to force the theme to display elements as if it were a single/multi author blog, regardless of whether there are posts by multiple authors or not.

The options are:
* Auto
* Always display as if single author
* Always display as if multi author
